    if age_input.lower() == 'quit':
        print("Goodbye!")
        break

    age = int(age_input)

    if age < 3:
        print("Your ticket is free.")

Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches.

After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made.

# List of sandwich orders
sandwich_orders = ['tuna', 'ham', 'turkey', 'veggie', 'chicken']
finished_sandwiches = []

while sandwich_orders:
    current_sandwich = sandwich_orders.pop(0)
    print(f"I made your {current_sandwich} sandwich.")
    finished_sandwiches.append(current_sandwich)

# Print all finished sandwiches
print("\nAll sandwiches made:")
for sandwich in finished_sandwiches:
