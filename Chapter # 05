Question # 01 ;

Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a

variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red

# Assign a color to the alien
alien_color = 'green'  # Try 'yellow' or 'red' as well

# Check the alien's color and print the appropriate message
if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
elif alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("You just earned 10 points!")
elif alien_color == 'red':
    print("You just earned 15 points!")
else:
    print("Unknown alien color!")

Question #02;

Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write an if-else chain
 
# Exercise 5-4: Alien Colors #2

alien_color = 'yellow'  # Chosen color: 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points for shooting the green alien!")
else:
    print("You just earned 10 points!")

Question #03
 Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 5-4 into an if-elifelse chain.
•	 If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
•	 If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
•	 If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
•	 Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed 
for the appropriate color alien.
# Version 1: Alien is green
alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
elif alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("You just earned 10 points!")
else:
    print("You just earned 15 points!")

# Version 2: Alien is yellow
alien_color = 'yellow'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
elif alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("You just earned 10 points!")
else:
    print("You just earned 15 points!")

# Version 3: Alien is red
alien_color = 'red'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")
elif alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("You just earned 10 points!")
else:
    print("You just earned 15 points!")
